# Jumpcut
A minimalist application to provide clipboard buffering for macOS written by snarkout.

This repo is an import from https://sourceforge.net/projects/jumpcut/

For more details, please see the original project page.

Retaining the license of the original author, which is MIT license. All credits goes to the original author.

## Purpose:
The original app served me well as it worked well until macOS Mojave. When I switched to macOS Catalina, this was the app that I immediately missed. Hence this repo. 

This repo makes the app 64-bit compatible and thus supports macOS Catalina. I love this app for its minimalism and thus I would not attempt to add features. 

## Compatibility:
macOS 10.6 (Snow Leopard) ~ 10.15 (macOS Catalina)

Note: I have tested this only in Mojave and Catalina.

## Install:

1. Build and run:
- Get [Xcode 10.2.1](https://developer.apple.com/download/)
- Download the [code](https://github.com/Kiran-B/Jumpcut/archive/0.0.66.tar.gz) and build/run the app.
2. Allow the app to run accepting the risk that it was from an unidentified developer. Here is how you may do it:
- control-click (right-click) the app icon, then choose Open from the contextual menu.
- You would see an alert that says Jumpcut is from an unidentified developer. Click `Open` in the alert.

The above step will be a one time thing.
