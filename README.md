# Jumpcut
A minimalist application to provide clipboard buffering for OS X, originally written by snarkout.

This repo is an import from https://sourceforge.net/projects/jumpcut/

For more details, please see the original project page.

Retaining the license of the original author, which is MIT license. All credits goes to the original author.

## Purpose:
The original app served me well as it worked flawlessly until macOS Mojave. When I switched to macOS Catalina, this was the app that I immediately missed. Hence this repo. 

This repo makes the app 64-bit compatible and thus support macOS Catalina. I love this app for its minimalism and thus I would not attempt to add features. 

## TODO:
[ ] Support paste from menu selection

[ ] Explore whether a code-signed/notarized build can be generated 

[ ] Distribution via Homebrew

[ ] Update image assets to support Retina screen, if anyone could contribute image assets. 

### Build:

Use Xcode 10.2.1
